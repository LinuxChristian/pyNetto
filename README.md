# pyNetto
Ever wonder how much you spend on Hummus? I did. So I build this library.

**pyNetto** is a small script that reads your Netto reciptes directly from your email and turns them into a Pandas Dataframe for further processing. The script contains some small examples of how to use the code.

**NOTE**: This software is not associated with Netto in any way. It is provided under a GPLv3 license without any support. Please relate any issues with the App to [Netto](https://netto.dk/kundeservice/).

## Install directly from github
> pip install git+https://github.com/LinuxChristian/pyNetto

## Getting started
* Get the Netto Scan&Go app - [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.dsg.scanandgo&hl=da_DK&gl=DK)/[iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/dk/app/netto-scan-go/id1424997991)
* Setup the app to send reciptes to your email and go shopping
* Install the Python dependencies required to run the script: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage from the command line
First, change the constants on line 150-153 to match your setting. Then run the script.

> python pyNetto/pyNetto.py

## Usage from a separate script or Jupyter
```python
from pyNetto import pyNetto

# Scan your Inbox for reciepts
imap = pyNetto.connect_to_imap(server, username, password)
df = pyNetto.process_emails(imap, "INBOX")

print(df.head())
```

## Example output

``` shell
> python pyNetto.py

## Important variables
These settings are dependent upon your email provider. You can likely find the settings for your provider on their website.

- `USERNAME` : Your IMAP username (might be your email address)
- `PASSWORD` : The password to your IMAP/email account
- `IMAP_SERVER` : Your email server (e.g. `imap.google.com` or `imap.fastmail.com`)
- `EMAIL_FOLDER` : This should point to the folder where your emails are stored on the server. If all emails are in your inbox put `INBOX`.
